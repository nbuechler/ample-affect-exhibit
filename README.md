# ample-affect-exhibit
A user interface, comprising data visualizations and analytics, to show data that is created from affects - specifically natural language

# About the project
#### Affect
Affect is the measurable observation of an emotion.

	> e.g. A particularly relevant affect is natural language

	> Suggestion:  Learn about Affective Computing

Affects are defined by the observed reality (via some kind of sign) of a person.

	> Suggestion:  Learn about Semiotics

	Examples of affect include a facial expression, natural language sentence (Syntagram), tone, body temperature and/or another aspect of their person.

#### 'Representational' Emotions (R-EMOTION)
Linguistic labels (signifier/signified pairs) used to define an emotion.

	> Affects can be recorded and observed in sets of multiple R-EMOTION s.

	> e.g. A particularly popular set: Paul Ekman's Big 6

	> Suggestion:  Learn about EmotionML, see: https://www.w3.org/TR/emotion-voc/xml

#### 'Inferential' Emotions (I-EMOTION)
I-EMOTION s are an interpretation of how culture (as an emergent quality of human systems) constructs signifier/signified pairs of emotion where I-EMOTION s represent these as a vector of multiple R-EMOTION s.

	> Suggestion:  Learn about Anthropology

	> Suggestion:  Learn about Complexity Theory

	> Important: R-EMOTION s are symbolic and are not the same as 'Inferential' Emotions (I-EMOTION).

# History
This is the User Interface to display results from: speedy-affect-scorer. Additionaly, this project may one day become the UI to display information processed from computer vision, bioinference, and other forms of affect.

Find the project here: https://github.com/nbuechler/speedy-affect-scorer

* Approximately 400 representational emotions are categorized by speedy-affect-scorer, these do not absolutely map to the inferential emotion of a human, which will be described later
* A representation of an emotion is a label like 'Love' which reminds us humans of signifier/signified pairs (see semiotics)
* Usually, one human maps their signifier/signified pairs to single a representation
* This project introduces the newer concept of an 'Inferential Emotion'
* The emotion that humans experience via the 'lens of culture' are not representational but rather inferential - and to best understand the meaning we ought to rely more on a scientific process rather than a simple signifier/signified pairs (label) that acts as a representation.
* One-to-one relationships of 'Inferential Emotion' to 'Representational Emotions' are not common with culture due to the 'Complexity of Culture'. Humans might sometimes confuse and argue with each other about emotions due to this complexity, and their lack of understanding of emergence (see complexity theory). Remember, a label/word is only a representation (sign) of an idea. 'Anger' - the word/label - is not an inferential emotion (in all but a one case, where culture is homogeneously angry). The inferential emotion therefore might be represented by something like a set of words; e.g. A combination of n-set of labels (Anger, Sadness, Fear, etc.)


# Here is the inital scope, it's small

Display a user interface for natural language

(and the addition of lots of other words!)

# The extended scope includes:

* More User Interfaces when other forms of affect generation present themselves
* A combined user interface that cross relates multiple types of affect coming from a single source of data.

(These extended scopes are likely going to be seperate projects, so as to release finished work more often)

# Run the app

```
npm run start dev
```
