# ample-affect-exhibit
A user interface to show data that is created from affects

# About the project
```
Affect is the measurable symptom of an emotion that we observe. Affect allows us to use our linguistics to define an emotion, hence those language based emotions are called a 'Representational' Emotions (R-EMOTION). Affects usually are defined by the observed reality of a person, such as a facial expression, sentence, tone, body temperature and/or another aspect of their person. Affects can be recorded as a set of multiple R-EMOTION s. R-EMOTION s are symbolic and are not the same as 'Inferential' Emotions (I-EMOTION). I-EMOTION s are an inference to a the emotional qualia in humans which can be represented as a vector of multiple R-EMOTION s.

## History
This is the User Interface to display results from: speedy-affect-scorer. Additionaly, this project may one day become the UI to display information processed from computer vision, bioinference, and other forms of affect.

Find the project here: https://github.com/nbuechler/speedy-affect-scorer

* Appoximately 400 representational emotions are categorized by speedy-affect-scorer, these do not absolutely map to the inferential emotion of a human, which will be described later
* A representation of an emotion is a label like 'Love' which reminds us humans of a certain qualia
* Usually, one human maps their qualia to a representation, but this project introduces the newer concept of an 'Inferential Emotion'
* The emotion that humans experience via qualia do not have labels - and to best understand the meaning we ought to rely more on a scientific process rather than a simple label that acts as a representation.
* Humans will often map one 'Inferential Emotion' to their defined preset of many representational emotions. This might be why we confuse and sometimes argue with each other about emotions. Remember that a word is only a representation of an idea. 'Anger' - the word/label - is not an inferential emotion. The set of impulses in ones brain creates a quality and we can better refer to that qualia as the inferential emotion and it might be represented by something like a set of words; e.g. A combination of n-set of labels (Anger, Sadness, Fear, etc.)


# Here is the inital scope, it's small

Display a user interface for natural language

(and the addition of lots of other words!)

# The extended scope includes:

* More User Interfaces when other forms of affect generation present themselves
* A combined user interface that cross relates multiple types of affect coming from a single source of data.
